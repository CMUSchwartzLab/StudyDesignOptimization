# StudyDesignOptimization

Create study designs for clonal evolution hypotheses under resource contraints using simulation and multiparameter optimization.

Experimental results are written in each directory. The main optimization script can be found in various forms in the repository, though most experiments were generated using "modified_128.py". Figures were generated from the experimental results using "All Figures.ipynb".
